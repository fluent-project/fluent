# Anna

Anna is a cloud-native, autoscaling, tiered storage engine that provides a range of options for consistency. To build and run Anna on your local machine, please run `./scripts/build-kvs.sh` followed by `./scripts/start-kvs-local.sh` from the project root directory.

**TODO**: Add a longer description here. Also describe how to run just the KVS in Kubernetes.
